Description
    This project demonstrates implementing the same algorithm in three languages, Python, Java, and C++.   
    The following algorithm is used 
        Accept input from user
        Iterate through input string and place each character into a stack and a queue
        Empty both stack and queue
        Compare string both forward and reverse
    If the reversed string(from stack) matches froward string(from queue), item is palindrome
    Though this method is not strictly optimal in any language, the application of these data structures can be directly
    compared across languages. Variable names and comments are consistent across all versions, while adhering to different
    standards.

Highlights
    -prompt for user input
    -ignore different cases
    -stack and queue data structures
    -string comparison
